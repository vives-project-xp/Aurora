                The theme of our project is the Northern Lights. <br>
                We have created an interactive hallway using LEDs and sensors that follow people passing by and display random effects.<br>
                Through this website, you will be able to control the LED bar. You will also find our movie clip, pictures of the progress, 
                information about all the team members, and the necessary components.<br>
                We were intrigued to start this project because we believe it holds a lot of potential, 
                not only now but also in the future as we acquire more knowledge to further develop it. knowledge to apply into this project

                This was a 12-week project, during which the first few weeks were mostly spent on planning which components to use,
                what kind of software we could use with those components, and how to make everything work together.<br>
                With this project, we had a lot of freedom to explore different approaches and make it a reality.<br>
