                Our theme for this project, is the northern lights.<br> We have created a interactive hallway using leds and sensors. These will follow the people surrounding them, and be able to display random effects.<br>
                Via this site you will be able to control the LED bar. On this site you will also find our movieclip, some pictures of the progress, all the teammembers and the nescesarry components.<br>
                We were intreged to start with this project because we as a group thought this could have a lot of potential. Not only now, but for the future when we have more knowledge to apply into this project

                This was a 12 week project, where the first few weeks were mostly planning what components to use,
                what kind of software we can use with those components. And how to make everything cooperate with eachother.<br>
                With this project we have had a lot of freedom and diffrent approaches to make this project reality.<br>
                Sometimes there were some struggels with how we would manage the budget, and what to spend where.
