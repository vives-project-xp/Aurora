                Our inspiration for this project, are the northern lights. We have created a interactive hallway using leds and sensors. These will follow the people surrounding them, and be able to display random effects.
                Via this site you will be able to control the LED bar. On this site you will also find our movieclip, some pictures of the progress, all the teammembers and the nescesarry components.
                We were intreged to start with this project because we as a group thought this could have a lot of potential.
                With this project we have had a lot of freedom and diffrent approaches to make this reality.
                Sometimes there were some struggels with how we would manage the budget, and what to spend where.
                This was a 12 week project, ...blabla
